I would like to thank Professor Laurent Vanbever and my two tutors Ege Cem Kirci and Rui Yang, for this great opportunity. Their valuable feedback, continuous support, and excellent guidance played a crucial role for me and this work. I have learned a lot and am very grateful for this experience and the great collaboration.
